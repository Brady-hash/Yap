# Yap 
A mobile-friendly interactive messaging application. 

## Description
Ever had a wildly heated debate between sides of a strange discussion? "What if" games are fun intellectual debates and they get conversation between strangers and friends alike started with a simple answer. Yap fills in the gap between the social media landscape we see today where friendship circles stay the same size and the physical world where it is hard to add new friends into your sphere. Newly found friendships can be based on how people answer a random poll that updates daily in the Yap community. Private messages and group messages alike can pick up on the moral quandry raised in answering the question one way or the other. 

What side are you on today?
